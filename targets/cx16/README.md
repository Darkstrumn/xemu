A VERY reduimentary Commander X16 emulator. It's basically more about to
develop my emulator framework (Xemu) with another "target" more, than a
usable X16 emulator for an average user at this stage.

Currently:

* fixed text mode on Layer-1 only, for the default KERNAL mode ...
* no SD-card
* no keyboard input (!)
* no sound
* no sane speed control on the emulation
